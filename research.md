## Organ Transplantation 
Organ transplantation is last line treatment for organ failure. Organ transplantation began in the 1960's but was limited to transplant between twins due to immunologic rejection. The advent of immunosuppression has resulted significantly longer survival times. Notably some organs such as kidney's have significantly better survival times compared to other organs such as lungs. Our current investigations are assessing the role of microbiome with regards transplant outcomes.

## Asthma
Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Approximately 12 million individuals in the US have asthma. Recent evidence points towards the influence of microbial exposure as risk factor for asthma, treatment response, and disease severity. We are currently investigating whether serological markers of microbial are predictive of asthma diagnosis, disease severity, and immunologic biomarkers.

## Sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that attacks multiple organs, particularly the lungs and lymph nodes, and disproportionately affects African Americans. Pulmonary fibrosis is the number-one cause of death among sarcoidosis patients. Approximately 30 percent of patients develop a progressive, debilitating form of sarcoidosis, but the mechanisms responsible for driving worsening or resilience to the disease remain poorly understood. We are currently investigating the relationship between microbial exposures and immune responses in sarcoidosis and how relates to diagnosis and prognosis.
